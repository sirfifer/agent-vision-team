## What the Setup Wizard Configures

The Setup Wizard walks you through each of these steps:

### 1. Vision Documents
Create documents that define your project's core principles
and invariants. These become immutable standards in the
Knowledge Graph.

### 2. Architecture Documents
Describe your project's patterns, components, and technical
standards. The orchestrator can propose changes, but human
approval is required.

### 3. Quality Configuration
Set up test, lint, build, and format commands for your
project's languages.

### 4. Project Rules
Define behavioral guidelines injected into every agent's
context (e.g., "Always use TypeScript strict mode").

### 5. Permissions
Configure which tools and commands Claude Code agents are
allowed to run autonomously.

### 6. Settings
Configure mock tests, governance automation, coverage
thresholds, and KG auto-curation.

### 7. Knowledge Graph Ingestion
Ingest your vision and architecture documents into the
Knowledge Graph so agents can query them.

**Tip:** You don't need to complete everything in one
sitting. You can skip steps and return later via the
Setup Wizard button in the sidebar or dashboard.
