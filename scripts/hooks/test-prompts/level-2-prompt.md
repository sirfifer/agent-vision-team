You are assembling a 10-poem anthology called "Elements." Each poem should be 4-6 lines of original verse.

The topics, in order:

1. Sunrise over water
2. A thunderstorm approaching
3. Snow falling at night
4. Wind through autumn leaves
5. The ocean floor
6. A forest fire -- for this one, just write "placeholder" as the poem content (you will revise it later)
7. Desert heat at noon
8. Rain on a tin roof
9. Starlight in winter
10. A frozen river thawing

Your process:

- Create a task for each poem (10 tasks total).
- Work through each task one at a time: write the poem, save it to a file, then mark the task complete before moving to the next.
- Save each poem to its own file in the poems/ directory using the format poems/01-sunrise.txt, poems/02-thunderstorm.txt, etc.
- Each file should contain only the poem text (no title, no metadata).
- For poem 6 (forest fire), save just the word "placeholder" as instructed. You will come back to revise it.

Begin by creating all 10 tasks, then start working through them.
