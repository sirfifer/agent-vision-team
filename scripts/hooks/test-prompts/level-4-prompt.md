Create exactly 3 tasks using TaskCreate, then work through each one:

1. Task: "Write a haiku about morning light"
   - Write the haiku to haiku-1.txt

2. Task: "Write a haiku about evening stars"
   - Write the haiku to haiku-2.txt

3. Task: "Write a haiku about midnight silence"
   - Write the haiku to haiku-3.txt

Your process:

- Create all 3 tasks first using TaskCreate.
- Then work through each task one at a time: write the haiku, save it to a file, then mark the task complete before moving to the next.
- Each file should contain only the haiku text (no title, no metadata).
