# No Em Dashes in Generated Prose

## Statement

Generated prose shall never use em dashes. Replace with commas, semicolons, colons, or parentheses as appropriate.

## Rationale

Em dashes create formatting inconsistencies across different rendering environments and can cause issues in markdown processing. Using standard punctuation (commas, semicolons, colons, parentheses) produces cleaner, more consistent output. This convention is enforced project-wide across all agent definitions and orchestrator instructions.
